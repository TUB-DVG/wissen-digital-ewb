#+title: Prepare_test_import
In this file the preparation of the import test is documented.
This file is a work document.

* what should be tested
- It should be tested the input to the data base via the import function in the
  admin area of the django project.
* how should the test be done
- from a specific test file enargus_csv_20220902_test1.xlsx the input to the data base will compare the original
  data from the test file
- the test is run by a python script test_web_import.py
  1. import xlsx file
     - this file is build from a csv-file
     - for the import following is needed to be set
       - PLZ: string
       - cell seperator: ";"
  2. import data from data base
  3. compare some entries of the following features (feature of different formates)
     - [X] Laufzeitbeginn (date)
       - [X] Formate anpassen, sind durch den Pandas-import wahrscheinlich
         ungleich
     - [X] Kurzbeschreibung (character)
     - [X] PLZ_zwe (character)
     - [X] FÃ¶rdersumme (decimal)
     - the first feature
     - and the last feature
* what I doing right now
** [X] make an virtual environment called 'test_import_export'
- based on the requirement.txt
- python -m venv venv
- venv\Scripts\activate
- https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/
** [X] check it is the right db
* Test before/while merge into main
** [X] in import_export branch
*** [X] test import
*** [X] export
*** [X] run server
*** [X] sides
* open questions
** Should all libs used for testing also include in the requirements.txt?
- I think it is a good idea
-
** Should the task of making an new environment also part of the test script?
*** can python setup a test environment and activate this environment?
