| **License fee**                                      | Is there a fee for using the protocol or certification?                                                             |            |
| **Network topology**                                 | What is the physical and logical arrangement of devices in the network?                                              |            |
| **Implemented security mechanisms**                  | What security mechanisms are implemented to ensure data security?                                                    |            |
| **Bandwidth**                                        | What is the communication channel capacity (bandwidth) for transmitting data?                                        |            |
| **Frequency**                                        | What frequency or wavelength is used for communication (in wireless systems)?                                        |            |
| **Range**                                            | What is the maximum distance over which communication can be maintained without signal degradation?                  |            |
| **Implemented OSI-layer**                            | Which OSI reference model layers are applied for communication in the protocol?                                      |            |
| **Levels of building automation**                    | Describe the hierarchical structure for building automation where the protocol is applied.                           |            |
