# Configuration using .env file
One location to do global configuration for the `EWB Wissensplattform` is a `.env`-file. With this file environmental variables and secrets can be loaded into the application. In that way a central place for configuration is used. Furthermore secrets are not hardcoded in the source code and could be potentially be visual publicly on github.
