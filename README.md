# WenDE – Knowledge Platform for Sustainable Digitalization Strategies in Energiewende Construction

The shift from a traditional supply infrastructure to a regenerative, decentralized energy system introduces increased complexity and necessitates the integration of previously independent sectors. The efficient operation of these systems relies on modern IT communication and control technologies. This transition poses significant changes and new challenges for all stakeholders, alongside a substantial need for research.

Research, development, and innovation projects in the field of Energiewende construction, as well as real-world energy transition laboratories, focus on various aspects of this multifaceted topic. They conduct in-depth analyses of the economic, political, and user-specific requirements and challenges.

A key objective of the WeNDE project is to simplify and disseminate the findings from these projects. The EWB knowledge platform is being developed as a central element of this initiative. It serves as a repository where knowledge is aggregated and tailored for different user groups. The platform emphasizes the visual presentation of data, examines the impacts of varying conditions, and facilitates the application of technological advancements. It also involves the verification of digital tools and supports the testing and development of new methodologies.
